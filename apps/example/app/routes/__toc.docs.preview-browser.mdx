# \<PreviewBrowser \/\>

A pre-built batteries included template browser. If you're looking to create a custom preview browser, please see the **creating a custom browser** section.

## Props

Accepts any valid `<div />` prop.

## Basic Usage

An example of using the preview browser with `@react-email/components`. Anything can be used as your template markup, as long as it can be rendered to HTML.

<Shikiize id="basic" />

## Creating a Custom Browser

A custom browser can be created using the same `loadPreviews` function and the `usePreviews` hook. This hook gives you a list of previews along with the selected preview and its rendered output as a string. A custom preview browser may look something like this.

> # Note
>
> `loadPreviews` uses the `?preview=` query param internally to select the currently visible preview.

<Shikiize id="custom" />

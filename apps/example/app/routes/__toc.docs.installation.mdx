# Installation

`remix-mailer` contains a set of components and utilities that can be used to preview email templates. _(technically they dont even need to be emails, it could honestly be anything.)_

    <Shikiize id="install" />

## Basic Usage

The fastest way to get started with `remix-mailer` is to use the built-in `<PreviewBrowser />` component and `loadPreviews` utility.

    <Shikiize id="basic" />
